## Data Science in Art

The Metropolitan Museum of Art provides select datasets of information on more than 470,000 artworks in its Collection for unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use. These select datasets are now available for use in any media without permission or fee; they also include identifying data for artworks under copyright.

The purpose of this project is to create a showcase to show how the data science and machine learning models  would be applied into art by using Openaccess dataset of MET Museum.

Deployed app of the project found be at https://group2-tech-in-arts.herokuapp.com/

### Dataset

* https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess/blob/master/MetObjects.csv


### Questions

* How did World War II effect overall accession of MET art collection?
* Analyze how the cultures from all around the world are presented in Met Art Collection
* Analyze which countries made the most contribution to MET Art Collection
* Analyze how Chinese Art is presented in the collection
* Use Machine Learning Models to make predictions for Art Acqusition of Museum

### Tasks

* Clean and arrange the dataset using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook
* Develope front end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Create visuals using Tableau Dashboard and D3 library
* Use Random Forest and Arima Times Series Model to apply machine learning 
* Use Python Flask as web server and deploy with Heroku
